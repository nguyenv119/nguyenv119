 <summary><h3> üë®‚Äçüíª Who am I?</h3></summary>
 
Once upon a time, in the hot summer 2022, inside a cold, cold lab. Dripping alongside the solution I concocted was the patience I had for biochemistry. No more! I abandoned what I thought would be my lifelong pursuit. Planless with just 1 month to panic before move-in day, I carelessly latched onto a hot, trendy major. Why not? Was it a calculated move? Far from it, but when has life ever been about perfect decisions? With my groaning at the thought of staring at screens for hours on end, diving into pages of meaningless, monotonous text, I embarked on my CS journey in an airport terminal at 2AM with the specter of sleep deprivation looming large.

Yet, I persevered. For the sake of preparation, I waded into the unfamiliar waters of coding, beginning to understand simple algorithms, learning to think programmatically. Against all odds, I passed the placement test, skipped some prerequisites, and found myself thrown into the deep end.

In this new arena, I observed the stark duality of CS. A select few, brilliant minds, raced ahead effortlessly, while the vast majority grappled with the demands ‚Äî and they grappled hard. Some lost their spirit, their will to fight. They quit physically by dropping out, or emotionally by merely going through the motions in class, their vacant eyes glued to the projector, tears streaming down their faces. All under the crushing weight of a single question, "what's the point?"

So, why would someone choose this path? Why would someone willingly dive into a world of complex algorithms, data structures, and the relentless challenges of computer science? The answer is simple and yet incredibly profound: because it is hard. Because when we're up at 2 AM, eyes stinging, brain throbbing, but still coding away, we're pushing the limits of who we think we are, and what we believe we're capable of.

Life's various challenges, whether they be in CS classes, finances, relationships, or otherwise, test our mettle. They push us into questioning our self-worth, creating a void filled with doubts and the temptation to just 'stay put'. The same struggle that had us crying, staring blankly at the projector, also allows us to prove to ourselves that we can rise above the hardships, the exhaustion, and the frustration.

And that's the beauty of it. This struggle, this feeling of it not being easy, is where we grow. Because in every algorithm understood, in every problem solved, in every hurdle overcome, we discover parts of ourselves that we may not have known existed. We realize that we are more resilient, more tenacious, and more capable than we ever gave ourselves credit for.

This is the same spirit that drives me, the same reason I‚Äôm here, standing in the crossroads of challenge and change. I am not naturally smart, quick-witted and intuitive. But I am relentless, constantly pushing against my limits to humbly learn, improve, and conquer whatever problem separates me from my dream. Because it isn't easy, that's why it's worth it.
