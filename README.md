My philosophy is simple: do the best with the time given to you. We have only this day, this hour,
this moment to move closer to our goals. Talent may get you far, but, in my opinion, it’s confidence
and persistence that can take you anywhere.

Life is never “easy.” But in accepting that reality, we give ourselves
permission to lean into the struggle, to find joy not in comfort, but in progress.
